## Assignment 12

### Assignment 1
The first assignment was a continuation of the subway analysis from last week using Fourier's transform to identify stations with highest annual periodicity. I worked alone on the first portion of the assignment, and collaborated with Mei on the last portion-- with her guiding the understanding of Fourier transform and charts and myself a method for identifying the maximum stations. Many peers had questions on this portion, so I discussed my solution with several others including Angel, Qinyu (qg412), as well as my normal teammates Jerome, Andrea, and Fekade.

### Assignment 2
This assignment revolved around clustering areas in NYC. I worked on my own, referencing Andrea's (ah4412) code for guidance.
